# Garbage-Bag-Holder
The Household Garbage was stored in metal cans which are issued by the cities, and they are collected weekly by sanitation workers.  So many people threw the garbage directly into the bins; others used paper bags or any paper liners, which get wet and sloppy quickly. To get rid of that problem, The Canadian inventors Harry Wasylyk and Larry Hansen invented the garbage bag in 1951.  Sometimes something is as tedious as doing a simple odd job like taking out the trash out of the can becomes an awkward work to do. A few things we look for are like how hygienic the bin is! Or how the waste is affecting the environment? And how to keep those insects, bacteria and bugs away, how to clean the garbage bin, which all add up to a stressful situation.
